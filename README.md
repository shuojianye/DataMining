# DataMining
There are five project here:
# 1.
This project requires us to use 20 Newsgroup as dataset. The purpose is to classify the news into different group after training the model. The process include the natural language processing that extract features we need. Truncate the data size of key word we use. Applying SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers respectively on the data and analyze the result based on ROC curve.
# 2.
In this project, we still use the same dataset. The purpose here is using k-means clustering the data in each group. To trucate the data, we applied SVD and NMF respectively and using varying r, the number of word in each document, to test the accuracy.
# 3.
In this project, we are aiming to use KNN, NNMF, MF, and crossvalidation to train a movie recommendation model. The dataset used here is the MovieLens, where the csv file includes movie id, user id, and ratings. Based on the training result, we recommended the user the movies by analyzing the ratings they have. We also tried to seperate the movies into three groups: low popularity, high popularity and, high rating variance.   
# 4.
In this project, we used dataset of traffic data, where we aim to predict the traffic data's backup size depending on the week, day of week, hour of the day, workflow id and, file name. Through using different parameters and training models, we want to get the property of each regression models. 
# 5.
In this project, we are using the twitter dataset including the 6 hashtags, and each hashtags has tweets write in json. We want to pick the proper feature in the tweets and good models to predict the number of tweets in next 1 hour using the data from current hour.
